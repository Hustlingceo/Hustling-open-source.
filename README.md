# Hustling-open-source.
Idea is to update the code and launch as a open source project.

WE LAUNCH BACK IN 2016, WE CRASH AN BURN BUT I THINK IS TIME TO GET THE PROJECT TO BACK TO LIVE USING BITCOIN.

Manifesto:

At Hustling, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to make money doing what they love. Our platform connects people around the world, enabling them to share their skills, services, and experiences with others in a way that is simple, flexible, and accessible.

We are committed to creating a global community of hustlers who are passionate about their craft and willing to share their knowledge with others. We believe that everyone has something to offer, and that by providing a platform for people to showcase their skills, we can help unlock their true potential.

We are also committed to openness and transparency. Our platform is open source, meaning that anyone can access and modify the code that powers it. We believe that this openness fosters innovation and collaboration, and enables us to build a platform that truly reflects the needs and desires of our community.

Furthermore, we believe that Bitcoin is an essential tool for empowering people around the world. By integrating Bitcoin into our platform, we are providing our users with a secure, fast, and efficient way to receive payments for the services they offer. Bitcoin also provides a level of privacy and security that traditional payment methods cannot match, enabling our users to keep their financial information safe and secure.

We believe that the integration of Bitcoin and Hustling represents a powerful new way for people to make money doing what they love. It allows them to reach a global audience, receive payments quickly and securely, and enjoy the benefits of a decentralized digital currency.

At Hustling, we are committed to building a platform that empowers people and promotes creativity, collaboration, and community. We invite everyone to join us on this journey and become a part of the global community of hustlers who are making their mark on the world.
